# Stroke-Prediction

## Introduction
This dataset project focuses on predicting the likelihood of stroke occurrence based on various health metrics and demographic information. Stroke is a significant cause of disability and mortality worldwide, making early prediction crucial for preventive healthcare. The dataset includes attributes such as age, gender, average glucose level, and body mass index, alongside stroke occurrence as the target variable.

In this analysis, special attention is given to handling class imbalance, as well as detecting and managing outliers in the avg_glucose_level feature. The goal of the project is to build a robust predictive model that can accurately distinguish between individuals at high and low risk of stroke, aiding in early intervention strategies and efficient healthcare management.

## Dataset Description

The stroke prediction dataset includes demographic and health-related features to assess the risk factors associated with stroke occurrence. Below is a brief description of each feature:
### id: 
Unique identifier for each individual (not used in modeling).
### gender:
Gender of the individual, represented as "Male," "Female," or "Other."
### age: 
Age of the individual in years, captured as a numerical value.
### hypertension: 
Indicates if the individual has hypertension (0 = No, 1 = Yes).
### heart_disease: 
Indicates if the individual has any form of heart disease (0 = No, 1 = Yes).
### ever_married: 
Marital status, with possible values "Yes" or "No."
### work_type:
Employment type, specifying the individualâ€™s work environment (e.g., "Private," "Self-employed," "Govt_job," "children," "Never_worked").
### Residence_type:
Living environment of the individual, either "Urban" or "Rural."
### avg_glucose_level:
Average glucose level in the blood (mg/dL). May contain outliers requiring preprocessing.
### bmi:
Body mass index of the individual. Missing values may need imputation.
### smoking_status: 
Smoking habits, with possible values "never smoked," "formerly smoked," "smokes," or "Unknown" if data is unavailable.
### stroke:
Target variable indicating whether the individual has experienced a stroke (0 = No, 1 = Yes).


## EDA
# missing value tretment
In the stroke dataset, there are missing values in the bmi column. Initially, I filled these missing values with the median. However, using the median altered the distribution of the data, so I opted to fill the missing values with randomly selected values from the existing bmi data. This method better preserves the original distribution, as shown in the figure.

# trasformation
In the stroke dataset, the avg_glucose_level column exhibited an imbalanced distribution. To address this, I applied the QuantileTransformer, which maps the data to a uniform or normal distribution. This transformation helps in reducing the skewness of the data while maintaining its relative order, improving its suitability for modeling.

# Inbalance in data set
The stroke dataset is imbalanced, as shown in the figure below. This means that one class significantly outnumbers the other, which can negatively impact the performance of machine learning models by biasing them towards the majority class. To address this issue, we applied the SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) method during model building. SMOTE generates synthetic samples for the minority class to balance the dataset, improving model performance and ensuring better generalization.
