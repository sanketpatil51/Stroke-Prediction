## Introduction
This dataset project focuses on predicting the likelihood of stroke occurrence based on various health metrics and demographic information. Stroke is a significant cause of disability and mortality worldwide, making early prediction crucial for preventive healthcare. The dataset includes attributes such as age, gender, average glucose level, and body mass index, alongside stroke occurrence as the target variable.

In this analysis, special attention is given to handling class imbalance, as well as detecting and managing outliers in the avg_glucose_level feature. The goal of the project is to build a robust predictive model that can accurately distinguish between individuals at high and low risk of stroke, aiding in early intervention strategies and efficient healthcare management.
